#🐶Dog Game Project by Vivian, Carolina & Angela🐶

We created a simple app, which has a Dogs list, that shows 10 photos of each breed so you can learn the breeds and memorize them before starting our Dog Game(Dog Game 1).
The game itself consists of a breed photo and 3 possible answers. A click on the correct answer will redirect you to the next question, whereas a click on the wrong answer will show you the correct one and move to the next one. 
You can always check your stats and when you know your breeds simply click end game and see how good you did!

## [🐕🐩 Check out the deployed version here! 🐩🐕](https://gifted-meninsky-99153b.netlify.com/)
Deployed version only works in chrome!
The second game is not finished yet unfortunately.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
